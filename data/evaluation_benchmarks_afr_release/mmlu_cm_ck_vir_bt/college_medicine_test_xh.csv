"Using a sauna, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short-term exposure to extreme heat. This effect causes mild hyperthermia – an increase in body temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and make the body more resistant to heat stress in the future... For decades Recently, sauna bathing has emerged as a way to prolong life and improve general health, based on extensive information from observational, interventional, and mechanical studies. Of particular interest are the results from the study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men in eastern Finland, which reported a strong link between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity. … KIHD results showed that men who used saunas two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes than men who did not use saunas.[2] What&#39;s more, the benefits they received were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna twice as often, about four to seven times a week, received twice the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes.[2] In addition, regular sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These results held true even when looking at age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that may influence men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used a sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used a sauna only once a week... Health benefits associated with the use of -Saunas are expanding into other areas of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used a sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to have mental health problems, regardless of the men&#39;s dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammation status (as measured by C-reactive protein )…Exposure to high heat stresses the body, causing a faster, stronger response. Skin and body temperatures rise dramatically, and sweating follows. The skin warms first, rising to 40°C (104°F), then the body temperature changes, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F ) and rapidly rises to 39°C (102.2°F)... Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (beats per minute) increases and volume stroke (amount of blood pumped) remains constant.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat while bathing in a sauna.[11] Staying in extreme heat also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce blood volume loss. This increase in plasma density not only provides a stored source of water for sweating, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid rise in body temperature and promoting heat tolerance... Repeated use of the sauna accustoms the body to heat and improves the body&#39;s response in the future, perhaps because of organisms called hormesis, a protective response after exposure to a small stress that does not correspond to the intensity of the stress. Hormesis triggers a wide range of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to harmful substances… Physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate to vigorous exercise. Furthermore, sauna use has been suggested as an alternative form of exercise for people unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] Based on the article, which of the following would the author agree with?",Heart surgery patients who are unable to run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.,Patients on certain diets will benefit from sauna use.,Salt restriction is equivalent to sauna use in hypertensive patients.,Patients with skin problems can be cured with the use of sauna.,A

"Using a sauna, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short-term exposure to extreme heat. This effect causes mild hyperthermia – an increase in body temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and make the body more resistant to heat stress in the future... For decades Recently, sauna bathing has emerged as a way to prolong life and improve general health, based on extensive information from observational, interventional, and mechanical studies. Of particular interest are the results from the study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men in eastern Finland, which reported a strong link between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity. … KIHD results showed that men who used saunas two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes than men who did not use saunas.[2] What&#39;s more, the benefits they received were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna twice as often, about four to seven times a week, received twice the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes.[2] In addition, regular sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These results held true even when looking at age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that may influence men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used a sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used a sauna only once a week... Health benefits associated with the use of -Saunas are expanding into other areas of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used a sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to have mental health problems, regardless of the men&#39;s dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammation status (as measured by C-reactive protein )…Exposure to high heat stresses the body, causing a faster, stronger response. Skin and body temperatures rise dramatically, and sweating follows. The skin warms first, rising to 40°C (104°F), then the body temperature changes, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F ) and rapidly rises to 39°C (102.2°F)... Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (beats per minute) increases and volume stroke (amount of blood pumped) remains constant.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat while bathing in a sauna.[11] Staying in extreme heat also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce blood volume loss. This increase in plasma density not only provides a stored source of water for sweating, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid rise in body temperature and promoting heat tolerance... Repeated use of the sauna accustoms the body to heat and improves the body&#39;s response in the future, perhaps because of organisms called hormesis, a protective response after exposure to a small stress that does not correspond to the intensity of the stress. Hormesis triggers a wide range of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to harmful substances… Physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate to vigorous exercise. Furthermore, sauna use has been suggested as an alternative form of exercise for people unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] Which of the following is a possible paragraph that follows this passage in the article?",A protein complex that facilitates intracellular activation in response to heat.,A paragraph about the prevalence of heart attacks in the Eskimo population.,Evaluation of the Finnish water polo team.,A study of mice exposed to high levels of heat.,A

Hormesis triggers a wide range of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to harmful substances… Physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate to vigorous exercise. Furthermore, sauna use has been suggested as an alternative form of exercise for people unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] According to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of using a sauna?",Decreased risk of heart attack.,Increased stroke rate.,Improved mental health.,Decreased incidence of erectile dysfunction.,D
