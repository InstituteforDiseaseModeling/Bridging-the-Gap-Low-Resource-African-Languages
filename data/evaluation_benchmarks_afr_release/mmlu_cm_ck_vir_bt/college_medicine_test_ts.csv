"Sauna use, sometimes referred to as &quot;sauna baths,&quot; is caused by exposure to intense heat in a short period of time. This causes the body to undergo mild hyperthermia – an increase in body temperature – resulting in a thermoregulatory reaction involving muscle, cardiovascular, and muscular protective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and enabling the body to cope with future heat stress. Over the past few decades, sauna baths have emerged as a way to extend life and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men to from eastern Finland, which found a strong relationship between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity… The KIHD results showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week were less likely to die from causes related to the heart than men who do not use the sauna.[2] Additionally, the benefits they found were dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna twice as much, about four to seven times a week, had twice the benefits – and they wouldn’t die from heart-related causes in 50 percent.[2] In addition, regular sauna users have been found to be less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These results remained true even when age, activity levels, and factors that could affect men&#39;s health were considered.[2]... KIHD also revealed that regular sauna use reduces the risk of suffer from dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in proportion. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of Alzheimer&#39;s, as opposed to men who use the sauna once a week. The health benefits associated with sauna use have also been extended to other mental health issues. Men in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week were less likely to develop psychological problems, regardless of male habits, economic status, exercise, and status of inflammation (as measured by C-reactive protein).High temperature stresses the body, causing the body to react quickly and strongly. Skin and body temperature increase dramatically, or swelling increases. The skin becomes warm, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then there is a change in body temperature, rising gradually from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) it goes to 38°C (100.4°F) and rises quickly to 39°C (102.2°F). Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does in response to the body’s demand for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and heart disease rate (blood pump rate) remains unchanged.[5] Meanwhile, about 50 to 70 percent of the blood flowing through the body is redistributed from the skin to the skin to facilitate swelling. On average, a person loses about 2 pounds [0.5 kg] of nutrients during bathing. Hyperthermia also results in an overall increase in plasma volume to offset the decrease in internal blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a source of cooling fluid, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in body temperature and to promote endurance the heat. Repeated use of the sauna enables the body to warm up and improve the body&#39;s response to future stimuli, which may be due to something called hormesis, which is will enable the body to defend itself after a mild attack that is not commensurate with the level of stress. Hormesis activates multiple defense mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also protect against oxidative damage. The physiological response to sauna use is very similar to that found during moderate-to-vigorous exercise. In fact, the use of a sauna has been suggested as an alternative &#39;exercise for people who are unable to exercise due to chronic diseases or physical limitations.[13]According to this article, which of these terms the following that the writer might agree with?",A patient who cannot undergo cardiac surgery can benefit from a sauna.,Patients with unhealthy diets will benefit from using the sauna.,The dose of salt is equivalent to the use of a sauna in hypertensive patients.,Patients with skin infections can be treated by sauna.,A

"Sauna use, sometimes referred to as &quot;sauna baths,&quot; is caused by exposure to intense heat in a short period of time. This causes the body to undergo mild hyperthermia – an increase in body temperature – resulting in a thermoregulatory reaction involving muscle, cardiovascular, and muscular protective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and enabling the body to cope with future heat stress. Over the past few decades, sauna baths have emerged as a way to extend life and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men to from eastern Finland, which found a strong relationship between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity… The KIHD results showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week were less likely to die from causes related to the heart than men who do not use the sauna.[2] Additionally, the benefits they found were dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna twice as much, about four to seven times a week, had twice the benefits – and they wouldn’t die from heart-related causes in 50 percent.[2] In addition, regular sauna users have been found to be less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These results remained true even when age, activity levels, and factors that could affect men&#39;s health were considered.[2]... KIHD also revealed that regular sauna use reduces the risk of suffer from dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in proportion. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of Alzheimer&#39;s, as opposed to men who use the sauna once a week. The health benefits associated with sauna use have also been extended to other mental health issues. Men in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week were less likely to develop psychological problems, regardless of male habits, economic status, exercise, and status of inflammation (as measured by C-reactive protein).High temperature stresses the body, causing the body to react quickly and strongly. Skin and body temperature increase dramatically, or swelling increases. The skin becomes warm, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then there is a change in body temperature, rising gradually from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) it goes to 38°C (100.4°F) and rises quickly to 39°C (102.2°F). Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does in response to the body’s demand for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and heart disease rate (blood pump rate) remains unchanged.[5] During that time, about 50 to 70 percent of the blood flowing through the body is redistributed from the skin to the skin to facilitate swelling. On average, a person loses about 2 pounds [0.5 kg] of nutrients during bathing. Hyperthermia also results in an overall increase in plasma volume to offset the decrease in internal blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a source of cooling fluid, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in body temperature and to promote endurance the heat. Repeated use of the sauna enables the body to warm up and improve the body&#39;s response to future stimuli, which may be due to something called hormesis, which is will enable the body to defend itself after a mild attack that is not commensurate with the level of stress. Hormesis activates multiple defense mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also protect against oxidative damage. The physiological response to sauna use is very similar to that found during moderate-to-vigorous exercise. In fact, the use of the sauna has been proposed as an alternative &#39;to exercise for people who are unable to exercise due to chronic diseases or physical limitations.[13] Which of the following will follow the paragraph in this article?",A passage about proteins that facilitate endothelial function in response to heat.,Passages on the increased incidence of heart attacks among the Eskimos.,Restoration of the Finnish water Polo team.,A study in multithermal bats.,A
