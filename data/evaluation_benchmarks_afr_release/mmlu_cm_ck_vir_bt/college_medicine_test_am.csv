"Sauna use, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is known for short exposure to extreme heat. This exposure causes hyperthermia – an increase in body temperature – that involves neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and prepare the body for future heat stress. Stimulates a regulatory response... In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a method for increasing life expectancy and improving overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. In particular, findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) study, an ongoing population-based study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, identified strong associations between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... KIHD findings show that sauna Men who used saunas two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular disease compared to men who did not use saunas.[2] Additionally, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: those who used saunas approximately twice, four to seven times a week. Men had roughly twice the benefits and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular disease. [2] Additionally, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings were true even after taking into account factors such as age, activity levels, and lifestyle, which can affect men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also found that regular sauna use reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. He explained. Men who used saunas two to three times a week were 66 percent less likely to develop dementia and 65 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who only used saunas once a week... The health benefits associated with sauna use extend to other aspects of mental health. Men participating in the KIHD study who used saunas four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders (as measured by C-reactive protein) regardless of diet, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammation status. It irritates the body, causing a quick and strong reaction. Skin and core body temperatures increase significantly, and sweating occurs. The skin warms first, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then a core body temperature shift occurs, gradually falling from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly. It rises to 39°C (102.2°F)... Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s oxygen demand, increases 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (beats per minute) increases and stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped by the heart once the shunt) remains unchanged. [5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin, causing sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat during a sauna bath.[11] Sudden exposure to heat causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce the loss of core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only serves as a reserve fluid source for sweat, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in body temperature and promote thermal tolerance... Repeated sauna use facilitates the body&#39;s rewarming and the body&#39;s response to future exposure, possibly due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis. A compensatory immune response after exposure to a mild stress that is not related to the stress level. Hormesis triggers a myriad of defense mechanisms that prevent not only cell damage but exposure to subsequent adverse stressors... Physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate-to-vigorous exercise. In fact, sauna use has been suggested as an alternative to exercise for people who cannot exercise due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] Based on the text, which of the following statements can the author agree with?",Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.,Patients on a diet can benefit from sauna use.,Salt restriction is equivalent to sauna use for hypertensive patients.,Patients with skin diseases can be cured by sauna use.,A

"Sauna use, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is known for short exposure to extreme heat. This exposure causes hyperthermia – an increase in body temperature – that involves neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and prepare the body for future heat stress. Stimulates a regulatory response... In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a method for increasing life expectancy and improving overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. In particular, findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) study, an ongoing population-based study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, identified strong associations between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... KIHD findings show that sauna Men who used saunas two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular disease compared to men who did not use saunas.[2] Additionally, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: those who used saunas approximately twice, four to seven times a week. Men had roughly twice the benefits and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular disease. [2] Additionally, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings were true even after taking into account factors such as age, activity levels, and lifestyle, which can affect men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also found that regular sauna use reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. He explained. Men who used saunas two to three times a week were 66 percent less likely to develop dementia and 65 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who only used saunas once a week... The health benefits associated with sauna use extend to other aspects of mental health. Men participating in the KIHD study who used saunas four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders (as measured by C-reactive protein) regardless of diet, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammation status. It irritates the body, causing a quick and strong reaction. Skin and core body temperatures increase significantly, and sweating occurs. The body&#39;s skin warms first, rising to about 40°C (104°F), and then a core body temperature shift occurs, gradually falling from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly. It rises to 39°C (102.2°F)... Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s oxygen demand, increases 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (beats per minute) increases and stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped by the heart once the shunt) remains unchanged. [5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin, causing sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat during a sauna bath.[11] Sudden exposure to heat causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce the loss of core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only serves as a reserve fluid source for sweat, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in body temperature and promote thermal tolerance... Repeated sauna use facilitates the body&#39;s rewarming and the body&#39;s response to future exposure, possibly due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis. A compensatory immune response after exposure to a mild stressor that is unrelated to the stress level. Hormesis triggers a myriad of defense mechanisms that prevent not only cell damage but exposure to subsequent adverse stressors... Physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate-to-vigorous exercise. In fact, for people who cannot exercise due to chronic disease or physical limitation, using sauna is offered as an alternative to exercise.[13] Which of the following is a likely paragraph that follows this excerpt in the article?",Article on a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat.,Article on increased incidence of heart failure in Eskimo populations.,A review of Finnish water polo team excellence.,A study on rats exposed to high temperatures.,A

The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat during a sauna bath.[11] Sudden exposure to heat causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce the loss of core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only serves as a reserve fluid source for sweat, but acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid overheating and promote thermal tolerance... Frequent sauna use facilitates the body&#39;s rewarming and future exposure, possibly due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis. A compensatory immune response after exposure to a mild stress that is not related to the stress level. Hormesis triggers a myriad of defense mechanisms that prevent not only cell damage but exposure to subsequent adverse stressors... Physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been suggested as an alternative to exercise for people who cannot exercise due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] According to the text, which of the following is not a benefit of sauna use?",Reduces the risk of heart attack.,Increases stroke content.,Improves mental health.,Erectile dysfunction reduces libido.,D
