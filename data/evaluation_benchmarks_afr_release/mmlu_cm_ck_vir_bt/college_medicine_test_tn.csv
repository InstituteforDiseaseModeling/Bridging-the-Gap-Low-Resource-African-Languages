"Using a sauna, sometimes referred to as ""sauna bathing,"" involves being in short-term exposure to extreme heat. This possibility leads to a lower degree of hyperthermia – an increase in the core body temperature – which triggers a response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms working together to maintain homeostasis and the body's heat-producing state in the future… Over the past decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a way to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling information from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Particularly interesting are the findings from studies involving participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing health study of over 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong associations between sauna use and reduced mortality and diseases… KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 27% lower chance of dying from cardiovascular-related causes compared to men who did not use the sauna. Additionally, it was found that the benefits were dose-dependent: men who used the sauna approximately twice as much, about four to seven times a week, had nearly double the benefits – with a 50% lower chance of dying from cardiovascular-related causes. Furthermore, it was found that frequent sauna users had a 40% lower chance of dying from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity level, and lifestyle factors that could affect men's health… KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use significantly reduces the likelihood of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66% lower chance of cognitive decline and a 65% lower chance of Alzheimer's disease compared to men who used the sauna only once a week… The health benefits associated with sauna use also extend to other aspects of mental health. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week had a 77% lower chance of developing mental health issues, regardless of their dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammation levels (such as C-reactive protein levels)… Exposure to high temperatures stresses the body, causing a rapid, intense response. Skin and core body temperatures rise significantly, followed by sweating. The skin heats up first, reaching 40°C (104°F), and then there are changes in core body temperature, which slowly rises from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then quickly increases to 39°C (102.2°F)… Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does to meet the body's oxygen demands, increases by 60% to 70%, and heart rate (beats per minute) increases while stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged. During this time, approximately 50% to 70% of blood flow in the body redistributes from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. An average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat during a sauna session. Additionally, exposure to intense heat causes a temporary increase in plasma volume to reduce the overall blood volume in the body. This increase in plasma volume not only serves as a reserve for sweat but also acts like coolant in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid rise in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance… Regular sauna use acclimates the body to heat and improves the body's response to future potential stressors, possibly due to a phenomenon called hormesis, which is a protective response following exposure to mild stress that corresponds to the magnitude of the stress. Hormesis leads to various protective pathways that not only mitigate cellular damage but also protect against more severe stressors… The body's response to sauna use is remarkably similar to the experience of moderate to high-intensity physical exercise. In fact, it has been suggested that sauna use be considered a form of physical exercise for individuals unable to exercise due to chronic illness or physical limitations.

According to this article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?",Heart disease patients who are unable to exercise on treadmills may benefit from using a sauna.,Patients who have abstained from food could benefit from using a sauna.,Salt restriction will be equivalent to the use of a sauna in patients with high blood pressure.,Patients with skin diseases can be treated by using a sauna.,A

"Using a sauna, sometimes referred to as ""sauna bathing,"" involves being in a short-term state of exposure to extreme heat. This condition can lead to a mild form of hyperthermia – an increase in the core body temperature – which triggers a response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms working together to maintain homeostasis and the body's heat response... Over the past few decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a way to extend lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling evidence from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Particularly intriguing are the findings from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing health study involving over 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong associations between sauna use and reduced mortality and diseases... KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 27% lower chance of dying from cardiovascular-related causes compared to men who did not use the sauna. Additionally, the benefits appeared to be dose-dependent: men who used the sauna approximately four to seven times per week experienced nearly double the benefits – with a 50% lower chance of dying from cardiovascular-related causes. Furthermore, frequent sauna users had a 40% lower chance of dying from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that could affect men's health... KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use significantly reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66% lower risk of developing dementia and a 65% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to men who used the sauna only once a week... The health benefits associated with sauna use also extend to other aspects of mental health. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week had a 77% lower risk of developing psychotic disorders, regardless of their dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammation levels (such as C-reactive protein levels)... Exposure to high temperatures stresses the body, causing a rapid, intense response. Skin and core body temperatures rise significantly, followed by sweating. The skin heats up first, reaching 40°C (104°F), and then core body temperature changes, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then quickly to 39°C (102.2°F)... Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does to meet the body's oxygen demands, increases by 60% to 70%, and heart rate (beats per minute) increases while stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged. During this time, approximately 50% to 70% of blood flow in the body redistributes from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. An average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat during a sauna session... Acute heat exposure causes a temporary increase in plasma volume to offset the loss of body fluids through sweating. This plasma volume expansion not only serves as a reserve for sweat but also acts like a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid rise in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance... Regular sauna use acclimates the body to heat and improves the body's response to future stressors, possibly due to a phenomenon called hormesis, which is a protective response following exposure to a mild stressor. Hormesis activates various protective pathways that not only mitigate cellular damage but also protect against more severe stressors... The body's response to sauna use is remarkably similar to the experience of moderate to high-intensity physical exercise. In fact, it has been suggested that sauna use be considered a form of exercise for individuals unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic illness or physical limitations.",A paragraph about a protein that facilitates the function of cells in response to heat.,The paragraph concerns the increase in heart attacks among the Eskimo population.,Information showing the high standards of the Finnish water polo team.,Research concerning scorpions with a high level of venom.,A

This plasma volume increase not only replenishes the sweat reservoir but also acts like coolant in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid rise in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance... Regular sauna use acclimates the body to heat and improves the body's response to future stressors, possibly due to a phenomenon called hormesis, which is a protective response following mild stress exposure. Hormesis activates various protective pathways that not only mitigate cellular damage but also protect against more severe stressors... The body's response to sauna use is remarkably similar to the experience of moderate to high-intensity exercise. In fact, it has been suggested that sauna use be considered a form of exercise for individuals unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic illness or physical limitations.[13]
