"Sauna use, sometimes known as &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short periods of passive exposure to intense heat. This exposure produces mild hyperthermia - an increase in core body temperature - which triggers a thermoregulatory response that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective functions that work together to restore homeostasis and body temperature for body temperature stressors. the future... In recent centuries, sauna bathing has emerged as a way to increase life expectancy and improve life in general, based on the art of creating technical skills from observational, interventional and research of mechanics. Of particular interest are the findings from the study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) STUDY, which is ongoing in a prospective population based on a cohort study of similar outcomes. of health in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from Finland, which found strong links between sauna use and reduced rates of disease... KIHD findings showed that men who used saunas twice or more three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes than men who did not use a sauna. [2] In addition, the benefits they experienced were found to be depends on the dose: Men who used the sauna about twice as often, about seven times a week, had about twice the benefitsâ€”and were 50 percent more likely to not die from cardiovascular-related causes. [2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to have a 40 percent chance of not dying from premature death. Experiences are considered true even if age, job status, and lifestyle factors that may have influenced men&#39;s lives are considered. [2]... KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna exposure reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used a sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used the sauna only once a week... The benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health. Men who took part in the KIHD study who used a sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop a psychotic disorder, regardless of the men&#39;s eating habits. grass, economic activity, physical activity, level of inflammation (as measured by C-reactive protein)...Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, showing a rapid and strong reaction. The temperatures of the palms and core of the body increase dramatically and sweating follows. The skin warms first, rising to 40 degrees C (104 F), then changes in temperature, rising slowly from 37 degrees C (98.6 F or normal) to 38 degrees C (100.4 F) and rising rapidly to 39 degrees C (102.2 F)... Cardia&#39;s response, a measure of the amount of work done by the heart in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the rate of heart rate (beats per minute) increases and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains the same. [5] During this time, about 60 to 70 percent of blood flow is recirculated from the central nervous system to the skin to facilitate sweating. Normally a person loses 0.5 kg of sweat when bathing in a sauna. [1] Acute exposure also causes a short-term increase in plasma in general to reduce the decrease in blood volume in the body. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a source of fluid for sweating, but also acts as a fluid in the radiator, cooling the body to avoid rapid increases in body temperature and promoting endurance. heat... Repeated use of the sauna prepares the body for heat and increases the body&#39;s response to future exposures, which can occur due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a forced inhibition of the response to exposure to a medium stressor response to multiple stressors. Hormesis overcomes a variety of defense mechanisms that not only repair damaged cells but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to severe stressors... The body&#39;s responses to sauna use are very similar to those experienced during exercise. it is strong and fast. In fact, the introduction of the sauna is proposed as a different form of exercise for people who are unable to deal with physical activities due to ankylosing spondylitis or physical deficiencies. [13] According to this passage, which of the following statements can the author agree with?",Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.,Diet patients may benefit from its use.,Salt restriction will be equivalent to sauna use for hypertensive patients.,People with skin problems can be treated with the use of a sauna.,A

"Sauna use, sometimes known as &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short periods of passive exposure to intense heat. This exposure produces mild hyperthermia - an increase in core body temperature - which triggers a thermoregulatory response that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective functions that work together to restore homeostasis and body temperature for body temperature stressors. the future... In recent centuries, sauna bathing has emerged as a way to increase life expectancy and improve life in general, based on the art of creating technical skills from observational, interventional and research of mechanics. Of particular interest are the findings from the study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) STUDY, which is ongoing in a prospective population based on a cohort study of similar outcomes. of health in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from Finland, which found strong links between sauna use and reduced rates of disease... KIHD findings showed that men who used saunas twice or more three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes than men who did not use a sauna. [2] In addition, the benefits they experienced were found to be depends on the dose: Men who used the sauna about twice as often, about seven times a week, had about twice the benefitsâ€”and were 50 percent more likely to not die from cardiovascular-related causes. [2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to have a 40 percent chance of not dying from premature death. Experiences are considered true even if age, job status, and lifestyle factors that may have influenced men&#39;s lives are considered. [2]... KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna exposure reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used a sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used the sauna only once a week... The benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health. Men who took part in the KIHD study who used a sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop a psychotic disorder, regardless of the men&#39;s eating habits. grass, economic activity, physical activity, level of inflammation (as measured by C-reactive protein)...Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, showing a rapid and strong reaction. The temperatures of the palms and core of the body increase dramatically and sweating follows. The skin warms first, rising to 40 degrees C (104 F), then changes in temperature, rising slowly from 37 degrees C (98.6 F or normal) to 38 degrees C (100.4 F) and rising rapidly to 39 degrees C (102.2 F)... Cardia&#39;s response, a measure of the amount of work done by the heart in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the rate of heart rate (beats per minute) increases and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains the same. [5] During this time, about 60 to 70 percent of blood flow is recirculated from the central nervous system to the skin to facilitate sweating. Normally a person loses 0.5 kg of sweat when bathing in a sauna. [1] Acute exposure also causes a short-term increase in plasma in general to reduce the decrease in blood volume in the body. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a source of fluid for sweating, but also acts as a fluid in the radiator, cooling the body to avoid rapid increases in body temperature and promoting endurance. heat... Repeated use of the sauna prepares the body for heat and increases the body&#39;s response to future exposures, which can occur due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a forced inhibition of the response to exposure to a medium stressor response to multiple stressors. Hormesis overcomes a variety of defense mechanisms that not only repair damaged cells but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to severe stressors... The body&#39;s responses to sauna use are very similar to those experienced during exercise. it is strong and fast. In fact, the introduction of the sauna is proposed as a different form of exercise for people who are unable to deal with physical activities due to ankylosing spondylitis or physical deficiencies.

Of particular interest are the findings from the study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) STUDY, which is ongoing in a prospective population based on a cohort study of similar outcomes. of health in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from Finland, which found strong links between sauna use and reduced rates of disease... KIHD findings showed that men who used saunas twice or three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes than men who did not use a sauna. [2] In addition, the benefits they experienced were found to be it depends on the dose: Men who used the sauna about twice as often, about seven times a week, had about twice the benefitsâ€”and were 50 percent more likely to not die from cardiovascular-related causes. [2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to have a 40 percent chance of not dying from premature death. Experiences are considered true even if age, job status, and lifestyle factors that may have influenced men&#39;s lives are considered. [2]... KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna exposure reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used a sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used the sauna only once a week... The benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health. Men who took part in the KIHD study who used a sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop a psychotic disorder, regardless of the men&#39;s eating habits. grass, economic activity, physical activity, level of inflammation (as measured by C-reactive protein)...Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, showing a rapid and strong reaction. Skin and core body temperatures increase dramatically and sweating follows. The skin warms first, rising to 40 degrees C (104 F), then changes in temperature, rising slowly from 37 degrees C (98.6 F or normal) to 38 degrees C (100.4 F) and rising rapidly to 39 degrees C (102.2 F)... Cardia&#39;s response, a measure of the amount of work done by the heart in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the rate of heart rate (beats per minute) increases and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains the same. [5] During this time, about 60 to 70 percent of blood flow is recirculated from the central nervous system to the skin to facilitate sweating. Normally a person loses 0.5 kg of sweat when bathing in a sauna. [1] Acute exposure also causes a short-term increase in plasma in general to reduce the decrease in blood volume in the body. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a source of fluid for sweating, but also acts as a fluid in the radiator, cooling the body to avoid rapid increases in body temperature and promoting endurance. heat... Repeated use of the sauna prepares the body for heat and increases the body&#39;s response to future exposures, which can occur due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a forced inhibition of the response to exposure to a medium stressor response to multiple stressors. Hormesis overcomes a variety of defense mechanisms that not only repair damaged cells but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to severe stressors... The body&#39;s responses to sauna use are very similar to those seen during exercise. it is strong and fast. In fact, the introduction of the sauna is proposed as a different form of exercise for people who are unable to deal with physical activities due to ankylosing spondylitis or physical deficiencies.
