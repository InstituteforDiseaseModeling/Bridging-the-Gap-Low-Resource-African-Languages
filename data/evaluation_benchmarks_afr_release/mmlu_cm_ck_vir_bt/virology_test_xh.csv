"As part of the Women&#39;s Health Review, researchers examined the role of chronic inflammation in predicting heart disease in women (N Engl J Med. 2002;347[20]:1557-1565). The researchers used a cross-sectional cross-sectional study. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and the women were followed for 8 years. The following table shows the estimated risk of cardiovascular disease (heart attack or stroke) over a period of 5 years by five groups of CRP levels in 30,000 women. The first five groups are used as the reference group. 1 0.49 mg/dL Risk score for women 1.0 6000 2 &gt; 0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000 One in five groups of CRP Level 3 &gt; 1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000 4 &gt; 2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000 5 &gt;4.19 mg/dL dL 4.5 6000 Based on the risk definition above, one can conclude that:",There was no risk of heart attack/stroke in women with CRP levels in the first fifth.,A decrease in CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Elevated CRP levels appear to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.,A
