"A new in vitro anti-HIV drug is being tested in a population of patients with HIV infection confirmed by Western-blot laboratory testing. Out of 200 people in the patient population, 100 are randomly selected to receive the drug. The medicine, which has no taste, is given in a cup of orange juice; some patients receive orange juice as it is. Nurses, doctors, or patients do not know which patients are receiving the drug. At the end of the study period, the number of CD4+ T cells is available for all participants. This is an example",A study that compares people with a certain disease to those without it,For a detailed analysis of the patient&#39;s condition,A study of a group of people with similar characteristics over a period of time to compare results,For research that analyzes information in a certain period,A

"As part of the Women&#39;s Health Study, researchers are investigating the role of multi-organ inflammation in predicting cardiovascular disease in women (N Engl J Med. 2002;347[20]:1557-1565). The researchers used a study design that tracked people over a long period of time. Blood levels of C-reactive protein [CRP] were measured before treatment and the women were followed for an average of 8 years. The following table shows the estimated risk of cardiovascular disease (heart disease or stroke) within 5 years of the bottom 20% of the population by dividing into five levels of the level of protein produced by the liver in 30,000 women. The lowest 20% of the population divided into five categories is used as the reference category. 1 0.49 mg/dL Women Relative Risk Number 1.0 6000 2 &gt;0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000 Quintile of CRP Level 3 &gt;1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000 4 &gt;2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000 5 &gt;4.19 mg /dL 4.5 6000 Based on the above related information, you may conclude that:",There is no risk of heart disease/stroke in women with levels of a type of protein produced by the liver in the lowest 20% of the population divided into five categories.,"Decreased levels of CRP, a type of protein produced by the liver, appear to increase the risk of heart disease/stroke.",Increased levels of a type of protein produced by the liver appear to increase the risk of heart disease/stroke.,There appears to be no correlation between levels of the type of hormone produced by the liver and heart disease/stroke.,A
