"Soap is used, sometimes called a &quot;soap bath&quot;, because it keeps a person at a high temperature for a short period of time. This effect causes mild hyperthermia - an increase in body temperature - which causes a thermoregulatory reaction that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis in the body for heat stress. &#39;future... In recent decades, spa bathing has emerged as a way to prolong life and improve overall health, based on compelling knowledge from carefully designed, applied, and methodologically sound studies. Of particular interest are findings from a study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD) Study, an ongoing population-based study of more than 2,300 men in middle-aged from eastern Finland, who found a strong link between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... The KIHD findings showed that men who used saunas two to three times a week Twenty-seven percent less likely to die from heart disease-related causes than men who did not use saunas. 2]Also, the benefit they got was dependent on the medicine: Men who used the sauna twice, about four to seven times a week, got up to twice the benefit - and with fifty percent(50%) prolong their lives from anything related to heart disease. 2] In addition, it was found that it is likely that those who go to the sauna frequently will be 10 percent less likely to die from all the causes that can cause quick death. These findings hold true even when you take into account age, work level, and lifestyle factors that can affect men&#39;s health. [2]... KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a drug-dependent manner. Men who went to a sauna two or three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of depression and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease. they compared men who went to the sauna just once a week... The health benefits of sauna use also extended to other areas of mental health Men in the KIHD study who used the sauna more often four to seven minutes a week reduced their risk of developing a mental illness by about 77 percent, regardless of their diet, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and social status. disease (as indicated by C-reactive protein)...Exposure to extreme heat causes stress to the body, making it react faster and stronger. The temperature of the body and the inside of the body rises a lot, and sweat comes out of it. The skin warms first, rising to 40 C (104 F), and then a change in body temperature takes place, rising slowly from 37 C (98.6 F, but it is normal) to 38 C (100.4 F) and then rapidly rises to 39 C (102.2 F)... Heart rate, which shows how much the heart is working in response to the body&#39;s need for air oxygen, increases from ten percent to seventy percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged. [5] At this time, about 50 to 70 percent of the blood that flows through the human body passes through the skin to make it sweat. a person loses about 0.5 kilograms of sweat when bathing in a sauna. 11] Acute heat exposure also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce blood loss. Not only does this increase in plasma levels create more hydration for sweat, but it also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent swelling. rapid increase in body temperature and promotes heat tolerance... Frequent use of saunas accustoms the body to heat and stimulates the body&#39;s response to &#39;a better way to deal with future problems, most likely due to a phenomenon known as hormesis, which makes a person less likely to get sick after experiencing a stressful situation a dream that is disproportionate to the severity of the stressor. Hormesis activates many of the body&#39;s protective mechanisms, not only to repair damage to cells but also to protect against other stressors. ... the physiological response of the human body to a sauna is very similar to that of a moderate or vigorous exerciser. In fact, it is recommended to use sauna acts as an alternative to exercise for those who cannot participate in exercise due to chronic illness or physical limitations. [13] Based on this article, which of the things mentioned below seems to be the one that the author agrees with?",Those with heart problems who can&#39;t run on a treadmill can benefit from using a sauna.,Patients with special diets can benefit from sauna use.,Not drinking salt will be like going to a sauna for people with high blood pressure.,Patients with skin diseases can be treated with soap.,A

"Soap is used, sometimes called a &quot;soap bath&quot;, because it keeps a person at a high temperature for a short period of time. This effect causes mild hyperthermia - an increase in body temperature - which causes a thermoregulatory reaction that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis in the body for heat stress. &#39;future... In recent decades, bathing in a spa has emerged as a way to prolong life and improve overall health, based on compelling knowledge from carefully designed, applied, and methodologically sound studies. Of particular interest are findings from a study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD) Study, an ongoing population-based study of more than 2,300 men in middle-aged from eastern Finland, who found a strong link between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... The KIHD findings showed that men who used saunas two to three times a week 27 percent less likely to die from heart disease-related causes than men who did not use saunas. 2]Also, the benefit they got was dependent on the medicine: Men who used the sauna twice, about four to seven times a week, got up to twice the benefit - and with fifty percent(50%) prolong their lives from anything related to heart disease. 2] In addition, it was found that those who frequent saunas are 40 percent less likely to die of all the causes of death. These findings hold true even when you take into account age, work level, and lifestyle factors that can affect men&#39;s health. [2]... KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a drug-dependent manner. Men who went to a sauna two or three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of depression and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease. they compared men who went to the sauna just once a week... The health benefits of sauna use also extended to other areas of mental health Men in the KIHD study who used the sauna more often four to seven minutes a week reduced their risk of developing a mental illness by about 77 percent, regardless of their diet, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and social status. disease (as indicated by C-reactive protein)...Exposure to extreme heat causes stress to the body, making it react faster and stronger. The temperature of the body and the inside of the body rises a lot, and sweat comes out of it. The skin warms first, rising to 40 C (104 F), and then a change in body temperature takes place, rising slowly from 37 C (98.6 F, but it is normal) to 38 C (100.4 F) and then rapidly rises to 39 C (102.2 F)... Heart rate, which shows how much the heart is working in response to the body&#39;s need for air oxygen, increases from 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged. [5] At this time, about 50 to 70 percent of the blood that flows through the human body passes through the skin to make it sweat. a person loses about 0.5 kilograms of sweat when bathing in a sauna. 11] Acute heat exposure also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce blood loss. Not only does this increase in plasma levels create more hydration for sweat, but it also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent swelling. rapid increase in body temperature and promotes heat tolerance... Frequent use of saunas accustoms the body to heat and stimulates the body&#39;s response to &#39;a better way to deal with future problems, most likely due to a phenomenon known as hormesis, which makes a person less likely to get sick after experiencing a stressful situation a dream that is disproportionate to the severity of the stressor. Hormesis activates many of the body&#39;s protective mechanisms, not only to repair damage to cells but also to protect against other stressors. ... the physiological response of the human body to a sauna is very similar to that of a moderate or vigorous exerciser. In fact, it is recommended to use sauna acts as an alternative to exercise for those who cannot participate in exercise due to chronic illness or physical limitations.

"Soap is used, sometimes called a &quot;soap bath&quot;, because it keeps a person at a high temperature for a short period of time. This effect causes mild hyperthermia - an increase in body temperature - which causes a thermoregulatory reaction that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis in the body for heat stress. &#39;future... In recent decades, bathing in a spa has emerged as a way to prolong life and improve overall health, based on compelling knowledge from carefully designed, applied, and methodologically sound studies. Of particular interest are findings from a study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD) Study, an ongoing population-based study of more than 2,300 men in middle-aged from eastern Finland, who found a strong link between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... The KIHD findings showed that men who used saunas two to three times a week 27 percent less likely to die from heart disease-related causes than men who did not use saunas. 2]Also, the benefit they got was dependent on the medicine: Men who used the sauna twice, about four to seven times a week, got up to twice the benefit - and with fifty percent(50%) prolong their lives from anything related to heart disease. 2] In addition, it was found that those who frequent saunas are 40 percent less likely to die of all the causes of death. These findings hold true even when you take into account age, work level, and lifestyle factors that can affect men&#39;s health. [2]... KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a drug-dependent manner. Men who went to a sauna two or three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of depression and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease. they compared men who went to the sauna just once a week... The health benefits of sauna use also extended to other areas of mental health Men in the KIHD study who used the sauna more often four to seven minutes a week reduced their risk of developing a mental illness by about 77 percent, regardless of their diet, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and social status. disease (as indicated by C-reactive protein)...Exposure to extreme heat causes stress to the body, making it react faster and stronger. The temperature of the body and the inside of the body rises a lot, and sweat comes out of it. The skin warms first, rising to 40 C (104 F), and then a change in body temperature takes place, rising slowly from 37 C (98.6 F, but it is normal) to 38 C (100.4 F) and then rapidly rises to 39 C (102.2 F)... Heart rate, which shows how much the heart is working in response to the body&#39;s need for air oxygen, increases from 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged. [5] At this time, about 50 to 70 percent of the blood that flows through the human body passes through the skin to make it sweat. a person loses about 0.5 kilograms of sweat when bathing in a sauna. 11] Acute heat exposure also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to reduce blood loss. Not only does this increase in plasma levels create more hydration for sweat, but it also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent swelling. rapid increase in body temperature and promotes heat tolerance... Frequent use of saunas accustoms the body to heat and stimulates the body&#39;s response to &#39;a better way to deal with future problems, most likely due to a phenomenon known as hormesis, which makes a person less likely to get sick after experiencing a stressful situation a dream that is disproportionate to the severity of the stressor. Hormesis activates many of the body&#39;s protective mechanisms, not only to repair damage to cells but also to protect against other stressors. ... the physiological response of the human body to a sauna is very similar to that of a moderate or vigorous exerciser. In fact, it is recommended to use sauna acts as an alternative to exercise for those who cannot participate in exercise due to chronic illness or physical limitations.
