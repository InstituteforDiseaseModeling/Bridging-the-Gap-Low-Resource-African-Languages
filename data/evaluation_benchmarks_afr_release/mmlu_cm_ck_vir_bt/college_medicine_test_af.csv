"A police officer conducts hundreds of traffic stops each year. When his supervisor reviews the officer&#39;s records over the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of different genders, ages and races.

"Sauna use, sometimes referred to as &quot;sauna bath,&quot; is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body&#39;s core temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors… In recent decades sauna bathing has emerged as a way to increase lifespan and improve general health based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from Eastern Finland, showing strong associations between sauna use and reduced identified death and disease… The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes than men who did not use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna about twice as often, about four to seven times a week, experienced about twice the benefits—and were 50 percent less likely to have cardiovascular causes. die.[2] In addition, regular sauna users are 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels and lifestyle factors that could affect the men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that regular sauna use reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. way reduced. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used the sauna only once a week week used... The health benefits associated with sauna use are also extended to other aspects of mental health. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men&#39;s dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (such as measured by C-reactive protein) …Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, which elicits a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures rise markedly, and sweating follows. The skin heats first, rising to 40 °C (104 °F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, slowly rising from 37 °C (98.6 °F, or normal) to 38 °C (100.4 °F) and then rapidly rises to 39 °C (102.2 °F)… Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, rises by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, about 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat during the sauna bath.[11] Acute heat exposure also causes a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car&#39;s radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promote heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to optimize the body&#39;s response to future exposure to heating, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis induces a wide variety of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to more devastating stressors... The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate to vigorous intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been suggested as an alternative to exercise for people who cannot participate in physical activity due to chronic illness or physical limitations.[13] Based on the article, which of the following statements would the author most likely agree with?",Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.,Patients on a diet will benefit from sauna use.,Salt restriction would be equivalent to sauna use in hypertensive patients.,Patients with skin conditions can be cured with sauna use.,A

"Sauna use, sometimes referred to as &quot;sauna bath,&quot; is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body&#39;s core temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response that includes neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors… In recent decades sauna bathing has emerged as a way to increase lifespan and improve general health based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from Eastern Finland, showing strong associations between sauna use and reduced identified death and disease… The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular causes than men who did not use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna about twice as often, about four to seven times a week, experienced about twice the benefits—and were 50 percent less likely to have cardiovascular causes. die.[2] In addition, regular sauna users are 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels and lifestyle factors that could affect the men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that regular sauna use reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. way reduced. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used the sauna only once a week week used... The health benefits associated with sauna use are also extended to other aspects of mental health. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men&#39;s dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (such as measured by C-reactive protein) …Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, which elicits a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures rise markedly, and sweating follows. The skin heats first, rising to 40 °C (104 °F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, slowly rising from 37 °C (98.6 °F, or normal) to 38 °C (100.4 °F) and then rapidly rises to 39 °C (102.2 °F)… Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, rises by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, about 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat during the sauna bath.[11] Acute heat exposure also causes a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car&#39;s radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promote heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to optimize the body&#39;s response to future exposure to heating, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis induces a wide variety of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to more devastating stressors... The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate to vigorous intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who cannot participate in physical activity due to chronic illness or physical limitations.[13] Which of the following is a likely paragraph that follows this excerpt in the article?",A paragraph about a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat.,A paragraph on increased heart attacks in Eskimo populations.,An overview of Finland&#39;s water polo team excellence.,A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat.,A

This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car&#39;s radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promote heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to optimize the body&#39;s response to future exposure to heating, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis induces a wide variety of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to more devastating stressors... The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate to vigorous intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who cannot participate in physical activity due to chronic illness or physical limitations.[13] According to the article, which of the following is not a benefit of sauna use?",Reduced risk of heart attacks.,Increase in stroke volume.,Improved mental health.,Reduced rate of erectile dysfunction.,D
With an increasing number of sprints the following happens:,the anaerobic effect gradually increases.,the pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.,blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L.,relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.,D
"Fire hoses always have a nozzle at the end of the hose, which works in part by reducing the surface area of the water leaving the fire hydrant to create a more powerful stream. If the initial velocity of water from a hydrant is 2 m/s, the pressure is held constant, and the end of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the beginning of the hose, what is the final velocity of water as it exits ?",2 m/s,8 m/s,5 m/s,6 m/s,D
