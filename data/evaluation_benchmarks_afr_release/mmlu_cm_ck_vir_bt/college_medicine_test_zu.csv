"Sauna use, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short-term exposure to extreme heat. This exposure causes mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body&#39;s core temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and prepare the body for future thermal conditions… In recent decades , bathing in a sauna has emerged as a way to increase life expectancy and improve overall health, based on empirical information from experimental, interventional, and functional studies. More interesting are the findings of a study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) study, an ongoing cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 young and old men from eastern Finland, which found a strong link between sauna use and reduced mortality. and diseases... KIHD findings showed that men who used a sauna two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who did not use a sauna.[2] In addition, the benefits they received were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna about twice, about four to seven times a week, received almost double the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, regular sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. This finding held true even after taking into account age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that may affect men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that regular sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dependent manner. in capacity. Men who used a sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used a sauna only once a week... Related health benefits and the use of the sauna is extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used a sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to have a mental disorder, regardless of the men&#39;s eating habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein). …Exposure to high heat stresses the body, causing a rapid, intense reaction. Skin and body temperatures increase dramatically, and sweating follows. The skin heats up first, rising to 40°C (104°F), then there are changes in core body temperature, gradually rising from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F ) and quickly rise to 39 ° C (102.2 ° F)… Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (number of beats per minute) increase and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains constant.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat while taking a sauna.[11] Exposure to extreme heat also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to offset the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a stored source of sweat fluid, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid increase in core body temperature and promote heat tolerance... Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and improves the body&#39;s response to future exposure, probably due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response after exposure to a mild stress that is not as great as the stressor. Hormesis triggers many protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to more destructive stress… The body&#39;s response to sauna use is remarkably similar to that experienced during moderately vigorous exercise. In fact, the use of the sauna is proposed as an alternative form of exercise for people who cannot exercise due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] Which of the following statements might the author agree with?",Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.,Patients on a diet will benefit from the use of the sauna.,Limitation of salt will be equivalent to the use of sauna in patients with hypertension.,Patients with skin conditions can be treated with the use of a sauna.,A

"Sauna use, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short-term exposure to extreme heat. This exposure causes mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body&#39;s core temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and prepare the body for future thermal conditions... In recent decades , bathing in a sauna has emerged as a way to increase life expectancy and improve overall health, based on empirical information from experimental, interventional, and functional studies. More interesting are the findings of a study of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) study, an ongoing cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 young and old men from eastern Finland, which found a strong link between sauna use and reduced mortality. and diseases... KIHD findings showed that men who used a sauna two to three times a week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who did not use a sauna.[2] In addition, the benefits they received were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used a sauna about twice, about four to seven times a week, received almost double the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, regular sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. This finding held true even after taking into account age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that may affect men&#39;s health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that regular sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dependent manner. in capacity. Men who used a sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used a sauna only once a week... Related health benefits and the use of the sauna is extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used a sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to develop a mental disorder, regardless of the men&#39;s eating habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein). …Exposure to high heat stresses the body, causing a rapid, intense reaction. Skin and body temperatures increase dramatically, and sweating follows. The skin warms first, rising to 40°C (104°F), then there are changes in core body temperature, gradually rising from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F ) and quickly rise to 39 ° C (102.2 ° F)… Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (number of beats per minute) increase and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains constant.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat while taking a sauna.[11] Exposure to extreme heat also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to offset the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a stored source of sweat fluid, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid increase in core body temperature and promote heat tolerance... Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and improves the body&#39;s response to future exposure, probably due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response after exposure to a mild stress that is not as great as the stressor. Hormesis triggers many protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to more destructive stress… The body&#39;s response to sauna use is remarkably similar to that experienced during moderately vigorous exercise. In fact, the use of the sauna is proposed as an alternative form of exercise for people who cannot exercise due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] Which of the following is the most likely paragraph following this passage in the title?",A section on a protein that helps intracellular function in response to heat.,A section on the prevalence of heart disease in Eskimo communities.,A picture showing the beauty of the Finnish water polo team.,A study on rats exposed to high temperatures.,A

The skin warms first, rising to 40°C (104°F), then there are changes in core body temperature, gradually rising from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F ) and quickly rise to 39 ° C (102.2 ° F)… Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (number of beats per minute) increase and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains constant.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body&#39;s blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat while taking a sauna.[11] Exposure to extreme heat also causes a temporary increase in total plasma volume to offset the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a stored source of sweat fluid, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid increase in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance... Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and improves the body&#39;s response to future exposure, probably due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response after exposure to a mild stress that is not as great as the stressor. Hormesis triggers many protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also provide protection against subsequent exposure to more destructive stress… The body&#39;s response to sauna use is remarkably similar to that experienced during moderately vigorous exercise. In fact, the use of the sauna is proposed as an alternative form of exercise for people who cannot exercise due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13] Which of the following is not a benefit of sauna use?",Decreased risk of heart disease.,Increased stroke volume.,Improved mental health.,The rate of reduction in erectile dysfunction.,D
For fast increasing runs:,the body uses more energy without needing as much oxygen.,the pH of thief tissue is less than 6.0.,blood sugar concentration drops below 3 mmol/L.,the amount of energy the body receives by using oxygen increases.,D
"Fire hoses often have a tapered hole at the end of the hose, which works in part by reducing the surface area of the fire water to provide a more powerful discharge path. If the initial velocity of the water from the fire hydrant is 2 m/s, the pressure is kept constant, and the end of the nozzle is 1/3 the initial area of the hose, what is the final velocity of the water when it exits?",2 m/s,8 m/s,5 m/s,6 m/s,D
"The pairs of electrons held in the form, FADH2 and NADH +H, together contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate:",6 ATP.,5 ATP.,4 ATP.,3 ATP.,B
