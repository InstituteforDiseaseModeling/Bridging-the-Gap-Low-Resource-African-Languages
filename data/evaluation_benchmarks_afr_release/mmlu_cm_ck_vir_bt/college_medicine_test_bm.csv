"Sauna use, sometimes referred to as a &quot;sauna bath,&quot; involves intense heat for a short period of time. This exposure induces acute cold – thereby increasing core body temperature – which triggers an inflammatory response involving metabolic, cardiovascular and cytoprotective mechanisms working together to restore homeostasis meaningfully and prepare the body for future heat stress. In recent decades, the subject of sauna has emerged as a means of increasing life expectancy and improving overall health, based on compelling data from experimental, technical and methods in studies. Of particular interest are findings from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) study, an ongoing population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 published middle-aged men in eastern Finland, which showed strong associations between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a higher mortality rate of 27 percent less cardiovascular risk than men who do not use saunas.Moreover, the benefits they found have been shown to be dose-dependent: Men who use saunas about twice as much, about four to seven times a week received about twice as much benefit – and had a 50 percent lower mortality rate from cardiovascular causes.[2]In addition, it was found that people who use saunas regularly have a 40 percent lower mortality rate from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even after taking into account age, occupational status and lifestyle factors that could have affected men&#39;s health.[2]... KIHD also reported that sauna frequent use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, on average compared to men who used the sauna only once a week. The health benefits of sauna use have extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week had 77 percent fewer psychiatric disorders, men’s diet, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and regardless of their inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein )…Exposure to high temperatures stresses the body, which responds faster, . which is strong. The temperature of the skin and core organs increases dramatically, and fever follows. The skin initially warms, rising to 40 C (104 F), followed by changes in core body temperature, gradually rising from 37 C (98.6 F, or normal) to 38 degrees Celsius C (100.4 F) and then rapidly increases to 39 C (102.2 F)... Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases with 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the volume used to pump blood) remains constant.[5]During this time, the percentage of body blood loss la about 50 to 70 is returned from the core to the skin to facilitate perspiration. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat when taking a sauna bath [11]. Extreme heat also temporarily increases total blood volume to alleviate the decrease in blood coagulation. This increase in blood circulation not only provides the sweat with a stored source of water, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid rise in body temperature and promote heat tolerance. Repeated use of the sauna adjusts the body to the heat and gives the body a positive response to subsequent exposures, usually due to a natural hormesis, the defense responded is a retaliatory reaction to a mild stress disproportionate to the magnitude of the stress. Hormesis stimulates a myriad of protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage, but also provide protection from highly damaging background stresses... Physiological responses to sauna use, including vigorous exercise moderate to intensity are very similar. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to exercise due to chronic diseases or physical limitations.[13] Based on the topic, the author is likely to agree with which of the following statements?",Cardiac surgery patients who are unable to ride on treadmills can benefit from using a sauna.,Patients who eat would benefit from using a sauna.,Salt restrictions will be the same as sauna use in hypertensive patients.,Patients suffering from skin diseases can be cured by sauna.,A

"Sauna use, sometimes referred to as a &quot;sauna bath,&quot; involves intense heat for a short period of time. This exposure induces acute cold – thereby increasing core body temperature – which triggers an inflammatory response involving metabolic, cardiovascular and cytoprotective mechanisms working together to restore homeostasis meaningfully and prepare the body for future heat stress. In recent decades, the subject of sauna has emerged as a means of increasing life expectancy and improving overall health, based on compelling data from experimental, technical and methods in studies. Of particular interest are findings from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) study, an ongoing population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 published middle-aged men in eastern Finland, which showed strong associations between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a higher mortality rate of 27 percent less cardiovascular risk than men who do not use saunas.Moreover, the benefits they found have been shown to be dose-dependent: Men who use saunas about twice as much, about four to seven times a week received about twice as much benefit – and had a 50 percent lower mortality rate from cardiovascular causes.[2]In addition, it was found that people who use saunas regularly have a 40 percent lower mortality rate from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even after taking into account age, occupational status and lifestyle factors that could have affected men&#39;s health.[2]... KIHD also reported that sauna frequent use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, on average compared to men who used the sauna only once a week. The health benefits of sauna use have extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week had 77 percent fewer psychiatric disorders, men’s diet, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and regardless of their inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein )…Exposure to high temperatures stresses the body, which responds faster, . which is strong. The temperature of the skin and core organs increases dramatically, and fever follows. The skin initially warms, rising to 40 C (104 F), followed by changes in core body temperature, gradually rising from 37 C (98.6 F, or normal) to 38 degrees Celsius C (100.4 F) and then rapidly increases to 39 C (102.2 F)... Cardiac output, the amount of work the heart does in response to the body&#39;s need for oxygen, increases with 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the volume used to pump blood) remains constant.[5]During this time, the percentage of body blood loss la about 50 to 70 is returned from the core to the skin to facilitate perspiration. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat when taking a sauna bath [11]. Extreme heat also temporarily increases total blood volume to alleviate the decrease in blood coagulation. This increase in blood circulation not only provides the sweat with a stored source of water, but also acts like water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid rise in body temperature and promote heat tolerance. Repeated use of the sauna adjusts the body to the heat and gives the body a positive response to subsequent exposures, usually due to a natural hormesis, the defense responded is a retaliatory reaction to a mild stress disproportionate to the magnitude of the stress. Hormesis stimulates a myriad of protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage, but also provide protection from highly damaging background stresses... Physiological responses to sauna use, including vigorous exercise moderate to intensity are very similar. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to exercise due to chronic diseases or physical limitations.[13] Which of the following possible paragraphs follows this part of the article?",Section on a protein that facilitates intracellular activity in response to inflammation.,A section on the prevalence of heart failure in the Eskimo population.,He is a good example of the Finnish water polo team.,A study of continuous high-temperature furnaces.,A
