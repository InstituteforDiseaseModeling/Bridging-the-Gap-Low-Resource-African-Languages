"A police officer conducts hundreds of traffic stops every year. When her supervisor reviews the officer&#39;s records for the past year, she notes that the officer is equally likely to restrain people of different genders, ages, and races. However, it is much more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white men with dark hair and eyes. When confronted, the officer matter-of-factly states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence.

"Sauna use, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure evokes mild hyperthermia – an increase in core body temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and position the body standards for future heat stressors... In recent decades, sauna baths have emerged as a means of extending life span and improving overall health, based on compelling data to from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are findings from participant surveys in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study of health outcomes in over 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which noted strong links between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week were e -are 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who do not use the sauna.[2]Moreover, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent : Men who used the sauna about twice as often, about four to seven times a week, experienced about twice the benefits – and were 50 per cent more likely to die less due to related cardiovascular causes.[2]In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from causes by all of premature death. These findings were true even when taking into account age, level of activity, and lifestyle factors that may have influenced the men&#39;s health.[2]... KIHD e also revealed that frequent sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used the sauna only once a week… The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to have psychiatric disorders, regardless of men’s habits dieters, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein )…Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, provoking a rapid and robust response. Skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin warms first, rising to 40 C (104 F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37 C (98.6 F, or normal) to to 38 C (100.4 F) and then increases rapidly to 39 C (102.2 F)... Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work that heart does in response to a body&#39;s need oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (number of beats per minute) increases and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains constant.[5]During this period , about 50 to 70 percent of the body’s blood flow is redistributed from the spinal cord to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat when taking a sauna bath.[11]Intense heat exposure also induces a temporary increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in baseline blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a fluid storage source for sweating, but also acts like the water in the car’s radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid increase in core body temperature and promotes heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and causes the body’s response to improve future exposure, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory protective response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis induces an extensive array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposure to more damaging stressors... Physiological responses to manipulation of the sauna are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. In fact, the use of a sauna has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to exercise due to chronic illness or physical infirmity.[13] Based on the article, which of the following statements would the author likely agree with?",Cardiac surgery patients who are unable to run on treadmills may benefit from the use of a sauna.,Dieting patients would benefit from the use of a sauna.,Salt restriction would be equivalent to the use of a sauna for patients with hypertension.,Patients with skin conditions can be cured by the use of a sauna.,A

"Sauna use, sometimes called &quot;sauna bathing,&quot; is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure evokes mild hyperthermia – an increase in core body temperature – which triggers a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and position the body standards for future heat stressors... In recent decades, sauna baths have emerged as a means of extending life span and improving overall health, based on compelling data to from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are findings from participant surveys in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study of health outcomes in over 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which noted strong links between sauna use and reduced mortality and morbidity... The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times a week were e -are 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who do not use the sauna.[2]Moreover, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent : Men who used the sauna about twice as often, about four to seven times a week, experienced about twice the benefits – and were 50 per cent more likely to die less due to related cardiovascular causes.[2]In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from causes by all of premature death. These findings were true even when taking into account age, level of activity, and lifestyle factors that may have influenced the men&#39;s health.[2]... KIHD e also revealed that frequent sauna use reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease, compared to men who used the sauna only once a week… The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times a week were 77 percent less likely to have psychiatric disorders, regardless of men’s habits dieters, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein )…Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, provoking a rapid and robust response. Skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin warms first, rising to 40 C (104 F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37 C (98.6 F, or normal) to to 38 C (100.4 F) and then increases rapidly to 39 C (102.2 F)... Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work that heart does in response to a body&#39;s need oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while heart rate (number of beats per minute) increases and stroke volume (amount of blood pumped) remains constant.[5]During this period , about 50 to 70 percent of the body’s blood flow is redistributed from the spinal cord to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses about 0.5 kg of sweat when taking a sauna bath.[11]Intense heat exposure also induces a temporary increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in baseline blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a fluid storage source for sweating, but also acts like the water in the car’s radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid increase in core body temperature and promotes heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and causes the body’s response to improve future exposure, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory protective response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis induces an extensive array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposure to more damaging stressors... Physiological responses to manipulation of the sauna are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. In fact, the use of a sauna has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to exercise due to chronic illness or physical infirmity.[13] Which of the following could be the next paragraph in this article?",A paragraph about a protein that facilitates intracellular activity in response to heat.,A paragraph about the increase in heart attacks in the Eskimo population.,Review of the skills of Finland&#39;s water polo team.,Study on rats exposed to high levels of heat.,A

This increase in plasma volume not only provides a fluid storage source for sweating, but also acts like the water in a car radiator, cooling the body to prevent a rapid increase in core body temperature and promotes heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and causes the body’s response to improve future exposure, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory protective response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis induces an extensive array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cellular damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposure to more damaging stressors... Physiological responses to manipulation of the sauna are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. In fact, the use of a sauna has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to exercise due to chronic illness or physical infirmity.[13] According to the article, which of the following is NOT an advantage of using a sauna?",Reduced risk of heart attack.,Increase in stroke volume.,Improved mental health.,decreased erectile dysfunction.,D
