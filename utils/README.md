# Utils

This directory contains Python files with functionality that is reused in scripts. These files are imported into scripts in the [`scripts/`](../scripts) directory. The files are organized as follows:

- [`create_openai_batch.py`](create_openai_batch.py): Contains a function to create and download the results of [OpenAI Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) requests.
- [`useful_functions.py`](useful_functions.py): Contains various utility functions commonly used in the scripts.
- [`useful_variables.py`](useful_variables.py): Contains variables commonly used in the scripts.

Note that these files are **NOT** meant to be run on their own.
