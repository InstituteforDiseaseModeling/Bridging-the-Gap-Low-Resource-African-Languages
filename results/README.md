# Results

This directory contains all results generated by the scripts in the [`scripts/`](../scripts) directory. These results are organized into subdirectories corresponding to both the experiments they are relevant to and the subdirectories of each respective script in the [`scripts/`](../scripts) directory (the [`scripts/`](../scripts) and [`results/`](../results) directories have matching subdirectories). Additionally, within each [`results/`](../results) subdirectory, result files are named to correspond to scripts within the corresponding [`scripts/`](../scripts) subdirectory.  

See [`scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md) for more information on the organization of the scripts and their output.
